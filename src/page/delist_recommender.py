        ### ðŸ“Š Methodology

        This section outlines how the delisting recommendations are generated, providing transparency into the data sources and calculations involved.

        **Goal:**

        The primary objective of this tool is to identify perpetual markets on Drift that may exhibit characteristics suggesting a need for review, potentially leading to leverage reduction or delisting. This is achieved by scoring markets based on several key liquidity, activity, and market size metrics.

        **Data Sources:**

        The analysis aggregates data from multiple sources:

        1.  **Drift Protocol Data:**
            * **Open Interest (OI):** Calculated by summing the absolute value of long and short positions held by users in each market, converted to USD using the current oracle price. This reflects the total value locked in open contracts on Drift.
            * **Trading Volume:** The total USD value of trades executed in the market over the past 30 days, fetched directly from the Drift API.
            * **Market Configuration:** Current maximum leverage allowed for each market.
            * **Oracle Price:** The current price feed used by Drift for the market.
        2.  **Centralized Exchange (CEX) Data:**
            * **Spot & Futures Volume:** Fetches 30 days of daily OHLCV data from major CEXs (e.g., Coinbase, OKX, Gate, Kucoin, MEXC, Kraken for spot; OKX, Gate, MEXC, HTX, BitMEX for futures) using the `ccxt` library.
            * Calculates the *average daily USD volume* across these exchanges for both spot and futures markets.
            * Calculates the *geometric mean* of the top 3 exchange volumes for both spot and futures to reward markets with liquidity distributed across multiple venues.
        3.  **CoinMarketCap (CMC) Data:**
            * **Market Capitalization (MC):** Fetches the current market cap (or Fully Diluted Valuation if market cap is unavailable) from the CoinMarketCap API.

        **Scoring (Total 80 Points + Boost):**

        Markets are scored out of a potential 80 points based on the following categories. Scoring uses exponential ranges, meaning higher values generally receive diminishing point returns. All input metrics (Volume, OI, Market Cap) are processed in their full dollar amounts.

        1.  **Market Cap Score (20 Points):**
            * Assesses the overall size and significance of the asset.
            * Based on CMC Market Cap (MC).
            * Range: 0 points for less than $1M MC, up to 20 points for >= $5B MC.
        2.  **Spot Volume Score (20 Points):**
            * Measures the liquidity of the asset's spot markets on major CEXs. Higher spot volume generally indicates better price stability and oracle reliability.
            * Metrics Used:
                * Sum of Average Daily Spot Volume (0-10 points): Range from < $10k/day to >= $1B/day.
                * Geometric Mean of Top 3 Average Daily Spot Volumes (0-10 points): Range from < $10k/day to >= $1B/day.
        3.  **Futures Volume Score (20 Points):**
            * Measures the liquidity of the asset's futures markets on major CEXs. Relevant for hedging and price discovery.
            * Metrics Used:
                * Sum of Average Daily Futures Volume (0-10 points): Range from < $10k/day to >= $1B/day.
                * Geometric Mean of Top 3 Average Daily Futures Volumes (0-10 points): Range from < $10k/day to >= $1B/day.
        4.  **Drift Activity Score (20 Points):**
            * Measures how actively the market is traded specifically on Drift.
            * Metrics Used:
                * 30-Day Drift Trading Volume (0-10 points): Range from < $1k to >= $500M.
                * Drift Open Interest (OI) (0-10 points): Range from < $1k to >= $500M.

        **Score Boost (Up to 10 Points):**

        * Markets listed in `DRIFT_SCORE_BOOST_SYMBOLS` (currently: `DRIFT-PERP`) receive a +10 point boost to their final score.

        **Recommendation Logic:**

        The final recommendation ('Keep', 'Decrease Leverage', 'Delist') is determined by comparing the market's **Total Score** against dynamic lower bounds (`SCORE_LB`) that depend on the market's **Current Maximum Leverage** on Drift:

        * **Score Lower Bounds (`SCORE_LB`):**
            * Leverage <= 5x: Lower Bound = 31 points
            * Leverage <= 10x: Lower Bound = 48 points
            * Leverage <= 20x: Lower Bound = 60 points
            * *(Note: Leverage 0x has a lower bound of 0)*

        * **Decision Process:**
            1.  Determine the applicable lower bound based on the market's current max leverage.
            2.  If `Total Score < Applicable Lower Bound`:
                * If `Current Max Leverage > 5x`: Recommend **Decrease Leverage**.
                * If `Current Max Leverage <= 5x`: Recommend **Delist**.
            3.  If `Total Score >= Applicable Lower Bound`: Recommend **Keep**.

        This approach aims to be more conservative with lower-leverage markets, requiring a higher relative score to maintain their status, while allowing higher-leverage markets more leeway before recommending a decrease.

        **Important Notes:**

        * This tool provides recommendations based on quantitative data. Qualitative factors (e.g., project roadmap, team, regulatory concerns) are not considered.
        * Data fetching from external APIs (CEXs, CMC) can occasionally fail or be incomplete, which might affect scores. The system attempts fallbacks where possible but defaults to zero values if data is unavailable.
        * Prediction market symbols (e.g., `TRUMP-WIN-2024-BET`) are explicitly excluded from the analysis.
