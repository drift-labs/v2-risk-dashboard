# Debug Progress Summary

## Overview
We are debugging issues with the backend state initialization and API endpoints in the v2-risk-dashboard2 project. The main focus has been on resolving a `vat_error` and ensuring proper market data access.

## What's Been Done

### 1. Backend State Initialization
- Added detailed logging to `backend/state.py` to track initialization process
- Successfully confirmed that backend state initializes with the RPC URL
- Verified successful loading of pickle snapshots from `pickles/vat-2024-12-21-15-19-45`

### 2. API Endpoints
- Added a `/health` endpoint to check backend state readiness
- Added a `/debug` endpoint to inspect state details
- Modified the `target_scale_iaw` endpoint with retry mechanism
- Added logging throughout the API layer

### 3. Frontend Pages Analysis
- Examined `orderbook.py`, `price_shock.py`, and `asset_liability.py`
- Found that frontend uses driftpy's market configurations
- Identified that frontend accesses market data through prefixed columns

### 4. Debugging Tools
- Implemented enhanced logging across the application
- Added retry mechanisms for state initialization
- Created debug endpoints for state inspection

## Current Status

### Working Components
- Backend state initialization completes successfully
- Pickle snapshot loading works (takes ~8.1s)
- Health check endpoint returns successful responses
- Frontend pages are properly structured

### Current Issues
1. **Main Issue**: `vat_error` persists
   - Error message: `"object of type 'MarketMap' has no len()"`
   - Occurs when trying to access market data through VAT

2. **Endpoint Behavior**
   - `/api/risk-metrics/target_scale_iaw` returns "miss" responses
   - Backend state reports as ready but market data access fails

### Next Steps
1. Modify market data access to use backend state's `spot_map` and `perp_map` directly
2. Implement proper error handling for MarketMap access
3. Add more detailed logging for market data initialization
4. Verify market data availability after pickle loading
